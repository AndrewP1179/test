Many women in Moldova at some moment of their life cycle are required to get a career break, and this is due to different reasons, most of them are primarily personal. It may be due to pregnancy, childbirth, to take care of children or the elderly. Another reason is the lack of expected career growth or development.

The global reports emphasize the extent of women’s contribution to the workforce and how women are needed at the workplace for the country’s GDP to go up.

However, many of those women feel the need to get back to the workflow and build a new career, but one of the most challenging parts of being on a career break is getting the right job, despite the opportunities in the market.

We understand how challenging is to look for a new job after a long break, with the fast-growing technologies many job roles have been created leading to different and various responsibilities in many industries.

That's where ‘’Femeie Restart project’’ comes in. We are committed to helping those motivated women get all the information & education needed to find a job and to learn more about the new work possibilities and how to keep up with digital trends. 

Our systematic approach includes skills assessment, job search training, and mentoring that helps women ensure they are prepared and sets them up for success in their search for employment and beyond.
