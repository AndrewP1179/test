IT Networking Event #5 attempts to build one or more relationships between the participant and a new geeky mate, founder and/or partner. It also represents an occasion during which these relationships are maintained and gives the chance of a follow-up to happen.

I part - every 2 minutes, you will meet a new interesting person you can talk to about your ideas, products, services etc. (It's a lot like speed dating).
